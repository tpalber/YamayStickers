# Yamay Stickers
Express your bhoepa identity with Yamay Stickers. Featuring stickers of Tibetan cuisine and culture.

Hopefully, we can build a community behind this where people can upload their own stickers, or work with graphic designers to create new stickers.
This repository just holds the stickers added to the app and is free to copy and use for your own means.
