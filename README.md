# Yamay Stickers
Express your bhoepa identity with Yamay Stickers. Featuring stickers of Tibetan cuisine and culture that can be used with your iMessage app. 
> Currently only available for iOS devices.

Hopefully, we can build a community behind this where people can upload their own stickers, or work with designers to create new stickers.
This repository just holds the stickers added to the app and is free to copy and use for your own means.
